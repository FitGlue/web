## Overview

The Intervals.icu destination uploads your boosted activities to your Intervals.icu account. Intervals.icu is a popular free training analysis platform that provides detailed performance analytics. FitGlue activities uploaded here benefit from Intervals.icu's advanced charting, fitness/fatigue tracking, and power analysis.

## How It Works

Activities are uploaded with available metrics and booster descriptions. Intervals.icu processes the data and integrates it into your training calendar.

## Configuration

No configurable options.

## Tier & Access

The Intervals.icu destination is included in **Hobbyist** (free tier).

## Common Issues

**Duplicate activities** — If Intervals.icu already receives the same activity from another source (e.g., Garmin Connect), you may see duplicates. Disable the duplicate source or use only FitGlue as the input to Intervals.icu.

**API key issues** — Ensure your API key is valid. Check Intervals.icu → Settings → Developer.

## Dependencies

- **Required integration**: [Intervals.icu connection](/help/articles/registry/integrations/intervals) (API key)
