## Overview

The Intervals.icu destination uploads your boosted activities to Intervals.icu for detailed power analysis, training load tracking, and fitness modeling. FIT files are uploaded with full data fidelity, preserving all power, heart rate, cadence, and GPS data. Your AI descriptions and enriched titles appear on your Intervals calendar.

## Temporarily Unavailable

The Intervals.icu destination is currently **temporarily unavailable**. FitGlue is working on restoring this integration.

## Setup (when available)

1. **Connect Intervals.icu** — See [Connecting Intervals.icu](/help/articles/registry/integrations/intervals). You'll need API Key and Athlete ID.
2. **Create a pipeline** — Add your source and boosters, then add Intervals.icu as a target.
3. **Upload** — Activities upload automatically. FIT files preserve full data fidelity.

## Auth Type: API Key

Intervals.icu uses an API key and Athlete ID — no OAuth required. Simple setup.

## Complete Data Fidelity

Unlike some platforms, Intervals.icu accepts raw FIT files. All your data — power curves, GPS tracks, metrics — is preserved exactly as recorded.
