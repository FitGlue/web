## Overview

Strava as a destination uploads your boosted activities to your Strava account. Activities from Hevy, Fitbit, or any source — enhanced with AI descriptions, muscle heatmaps, heart rate, and more — appear on your Strava feed automatically.

## Setup

1. **Connect Strava** — See [Connecting Strava](/help/articles/registry/integrations/strava).
2. **Add to pipeline** — Add Strava as a target when creating or editing a pipeline.

## Loop Prevention

If Strava is also your source, FitGlue won't re-import activities it uploaded. No duplicates.
