## Overview

Showcase creates a public, shareable page for each activity. Anyone with the link can view your boosted activity — no Strava or FitGlue account required. Perfect for sharing with coaches, friends, or on social media.

## Retention by Tier

- **Hobbyist** — Showcase pages expire after 30 days
- **Athlete** — Showcase pages never expire; build a permanent fitness portfolio

## Setup

1. **Add to pipeline** — Add Showcase as a target (often alongside Strava).
2. **Share** — Each activity gets a unique link. Copy and share anywhere.
