## Overview

The Showcase destination publishes your boosted activities to FitGlue's public Showcase page. Unlike Strava's text-only descriptions, Showcase renders full rich content — formatted descriptions, interactive heart rate charts, embedded images (AI Banners, Muscle Heatmap diagrams, Route Thumbnails), and shareable links with Open Graph social previews.

Showcase is the best destination for visual content. Every image asset generated by your boosters is displayed here, making it the ideal complementary destination alongside Strava.

## What Appears on Showcase

### Activity Page

Each boosted activity gets a unique Showcase URL featuring:

- **Hero image** — AI Banner (if generated) displayed at the top
- **Formatted description** — All booster output rendered with section headers and styling
- **Interactive charts** — Heart rate graphs, elevation profiles (from Chart.js)
- **Embedded images** — Muscle Heatmap diagram, Route Thumbnail map
- **Stats panel** — Key metrics (distance, duration, pace, HR, calories)
- **Social sharing** — Open Graph meta tags for rich previews when shared on WhatsApp, Twitter/X, Facebook, etc.

### Sharing

Each Showcase page has a unique URL you can share anywhere. The OG meta tags ensure a rich preview with image, title, and description when pasted into social media or messaging apps.

### Showcase Profile (Athlete Only)

Athlete-tier users get a **public Showcase profile page** at `/u/{your-name}` that aggregates all their showcased activities into a single shareable page. The profile includes:

- **Display name and stats** — Total activities, distance, active time, and strength volume
- **Activity list** — All showcased activities grouped by date, with thumbnails and key metrics
- **Direct links** — Each activity card links to its full Showcase page

Your profile URL is derived from your display name (e.g., "Jane Smith" becomes `/u/jane-smith`). You can find the link under **My Showcase** in the app header dropdown.

## Configuration

The Showcase destination has no configurable options. All activities sent here are automatically published.

## Retention

Showcase pages are retained according to your account tier. Pages older than the retention limit are automatically archived.

## Tier & Access

The Showcase destination is included in **Hobbyist** (free tier) — individual activity pages are available to all users. The **Showcase Profile page** (aggregated view at `/u/{your-name}`) is exclusive to **Athlete** tier.

## Common Issues

**Images not showing** — Ensure your pipeline includes image-generating boosters (AI Banner, Muscle Heatmap Image, Route Thumbnail). Without these, the Showcase page shows text only.

**Showcase URL not working** — The page may take a few seconds to become available after pipeline completion. If it's been more than a minute, check your pipeline status in the Dashboard.

**Social preview not showing image** — Some platforms cache OG data. Try pasting the URL again or using a fresh URL. Facebook's Sharing Debugger can force a re-scrape.

**Chart not loading** — Heart rate and elevation charts require browser JavaScript. If viewing in an app's in-app browser, try opening in your device's default browser.
