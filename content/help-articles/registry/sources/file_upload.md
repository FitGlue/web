## Overview

The File Upload source lets you upload activity files (FIT format) directly from your device. No external connection required. Perfect for importing from Garmin or other standalone devices, or recovering workouts not captured by connected services.

## Setup

1. **No connection needed** — File Upload doesn't require any integration.
2. **Create a pipeline** — Add File Upload as the source. Choose boosters and targets.
3. **Upload** — From the FitGlue dashboard, select a FIT file, optionally add title/description, and upload.

## Supported Formats

- **FIT** — The standard format from Garmin, Wahoo, and most fitness devices.

## Use Cases

- Import workouts from Garmin or other devices FitGlue doesn't integrate with yet
- Recover activities from device backups
- Manual import when automatic sync fails
