## Overview

The Streak Tracker booster monitors consecutive days of activity to help maintain motivation. Hit milestones at 7, 14, 30, and 100 days and see celebrations in your activity description.

## Configuration

- **Activity Type Filter** — Track streaks for Any Activity, Running Only, Cycling Only, Swimming Only, or Strength Only

## Tier

Streak Tracker is included in **Hobbyist** (free). No Athlete tier required.

## How It Works

Each time an activity is processed, the booster checks whether the previous calendar day also had a qualifying activity. If so, your streak extends. Miss a day and the streak resets. Milestone days trigger special celebration messages.

## Best For

- Building daily exercise habits
- Maintaining a running or cycling streak
- Celebrating consistency milestones with friends
