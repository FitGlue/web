## Overview

The Calories Burned booster estimates your energy expenditure using MET (Metabolic Equivalent) calculations based on activity type, duration, and your weight. Optionally, turn on Fun Mode to see your workout translated into food equivalents.

## Configuration

- **Fun Mode** — Show food equivalents alongside calorie count (e.g. "≈ 1.8 slices of pizza 🍕")
- **Weight (kg)** — Your body weight for more accurate estimation (default: 70, range 30–200)

## Tier

Calories Burned is included in **Hobbyist** (free). No Athlete tier required.

## How It Works

The booster uses scientifically defined MET values for each activity type — running, cycling, swimming, strength training, etc. — and multiplies by your weight and activity duration to estimate total calories burned.

## Best For

- Activities without built-in calorie tracking (e.g. strength workouts from Hevy)
- Adding a fun social element with food equivalents
- Quick calorie overview on your activity feed
