## Overview

The Muscle Heatmap booster adds a visual representation of which muscles you trained. Every exercise is mapped to muscle groups, and volume is calculated to produce a "heatmap" — emoji bars, percentages, or text — appended to your activity description.

## Configuration

- **Display Style** — Emoji bars (🟪🟪🟪⬜⬜), Percentage (Chest: 80%), or Text only
- **Bar Length** — Number of squares in emoji bar (3–10)
- **Coefficient Preset** — Standard, Powerlifting (emphasize compounds), or Bodybuilding (emphasize isolation)

## Tier

Muscle Heatmap (emoji/text) is included in **Hobbyist**. For an anatomical image diagram, see Muscle Heatmap Image (Athlete tier).

## Best For

- Strength training from Hevy or similar sources
- Visualizing muscle balance in your program
- Sharing training focus on Strava or Showcase
