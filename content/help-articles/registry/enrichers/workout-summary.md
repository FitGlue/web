## Overview

The Workout Summary booster creates a human-readable summary of your strength training workout. Instead of raw numbers, you get a formatted breakdown of exercises, sets, reps, and weights — plus headline stats like total volume and reps.

## Configuration

- **Summary Format** — Compact (4×10×100kg), Detailed (4 x 10 × 100.0kg), or Verbose
- **Show Stats** — Include total volume, reps, and heaviest lift in the header

## Tier

Workout Summary is included in **Hobbyist** (free). No Athlete tier required.

## Best For

- Hevy, or any source that provides strength training data
- Pipelines targeting Strava or Showcase
- Users who want their workout details visible on their activity feed
