## Overview

The Spotify Soundtrack booster automatically tracks what music you listened to during your workouts. When you complete an activity, FitGlue checks your Spotify listening history for tracks played during that time window and adds a summary to your activity description — track count, top played songs, and playlist identification.

## Temporarily Unavailable

The Spotify Soundtrack booster is currently **temporarily unavailable**. FitGlue is working on restoring this integration.

## Setup (when available)

1. **Connect Spotify** — See [Connecting Spotify](/help/articles/registry/integrations/spotify).
2. Add the Spotify Soundtrack booster to your pipeline.
3. No additional config — it activates automatically.

## Dependencies

Requires the **Spotify** integration (OAuth) to be connected.

## Output Example

```
🎵 Soundtrack: 12 tracks • Top played: Blinding Lights - The Weeknd • From playlist: Running Hits 2026
```

## Use Cases

- Track your workout music preferences
- Share your activity soundtrack on your activity feed
- Discover which playlists motivate you most
