## Overview

The Parkrun booster enriches your Parkrun activities with official results from parkrun.org. When you run a Parkrun and it syncs to FitGlue (e.g. from Strava), the booster fetches your official time, finishing position, age grade, and detects personal bests.

## Requirements

- **Parkrun connection** — You need to connect your Parkrun athlete ID. See [Connecting Parkrun](/help/articles/registry/integrations/parkrun).
- **Strava (or similar) as source** — The booster works with activities that have Parkrun event metadata (typically from Strava).

## Tier

Parkrun booster is included in **Hobbyist**. No Athlete tier required.

## What It Adds

- Official time from parkrun.org
- Finishing position
