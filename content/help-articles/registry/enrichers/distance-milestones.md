## Overview

The Distance Milestones booster tracks your lifetime cumulative distance and celebrates when you cross major thresholds — 100 km, 500 km, 1,000 km, and beyond. You can track all activities together or filter to a specific sport.

## Configuration

- **Sport Filter** — All Activities, Running Only, Cycling Only, or Swimming Only

## Tier

Distance Milestones is included in **Hobbyist** (free). No Athlete tier required.

## How It Works

Each activity with distance data adds to your running total. When you cross a milestone threshold, the booster appends a celebration message to your activity description showing the milestone, your total, and how much this activity contributed.

## Best For

- Runners chasing their first 1,000 km
- Cyclists tracking yearly mileage
- Anyone who enjoys celebrating long-term progress
