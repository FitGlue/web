## Overview

The Source Link booster automatically appends a deep link to the original activity in your workout description. When activities are imported from sources (Strava, Hevy, Fitbit, etc.), Source Link adds a clickable URL pointing back to the original activity for easy cross-referencing.

## Setup

1. Add the Source Link booster to your pipeline.
2. No configuration required — it works with all source integrations automatically.

## No Integrations Required

Source Link uses metadata from the importing source. No additional connections needed.

## Use Cases

- Trace activities back to the source app
- Keep links to detailed exercise data (e.g., Hevy sets/reps)
- Cross-reference between platforms
