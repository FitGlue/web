## Overview

The Goal Tracker booster lets you set periodic targets — weekly, monthly, or yearly — for distance, duration, or total activity count. Each activity shows your cumulative progress and a daily pace suggestion to keep you on track.

## Configuration

- **Goal Period** — Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly
- **Goal Metric** — Distance (km), Duration (hours), or Activity Count
- **Target** — Your numeric goal (e.g. 100 for 100 km per month)

## Tier

Goal Tracker is included in **Hobbyist** (free). No Athlete tier required.

## How It Works

When an activity is processed, the booster looks up your accumulated progress for the current period, adds this activity's contribution, and appends a summary showing your running total, what this activity added, and a daily target to reach your goal.

## Best For

- Monthly distance challenges (e.g. "Run 100 km this month")
- Yearly mileage goals
- Weekly activity count targets for building consistency
