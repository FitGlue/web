## Overview

The AI Activity Companion booster uses a Large Language Model to generate engaging, human-readable descriptions of your workouts. Instead of generic labels like "Running" or "Weight Training", you get a narrative that highlights your effort, conditions, and achievements.

## Tier

AI Activity Companion requires the **Athlete** tier. It's not available on Hobbyist.

## Configuration

You can customize the AI's output style and focus. The booster analyzes your activity data (distance, pace, elevation, etc.) and generates a description tailored to the activity type.

## Best For

- Runs and rides — narrative descriptions for Strava
- Strength workouts — combined with Workout Summary for rich posts
- Showcase pages — shareable activity stories
