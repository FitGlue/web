## Overview

Oura Ring is a smart ring that tracks sleep, readiness, and activity. FitGlue connects to your Oura account via OAuth and imports your tracked workouts. Heart rate data, calories, and workout duration flow through your FitGlue pipeline for enhancement and distribution to destinations like Strava.

## Temporarily Unavailable

The Oura Ring integration is currently **temporarily unavailable**. FitGlue is working on restoring this connection.
