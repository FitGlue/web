## Overview

Garmin Connect is the tool for tracking, analyzing and sharing health and fitness activities from your Garmin device. FitGlue connects to your Garmin Connect account via OAuth and imports your activities. Heart rate data, GPS routes, and training metrics flow through your FitGlue pipeline for enhancement and distribution to destinations like Strava.

## Temporarily Unavailable

The Garmin integration is currently **temporarily unavailable**. FitGlue is working on restoring this connection. In the meantime, you can use **File Upload** to manually upload FIT files exported from Garmin Connect.

## Setup (when available)

1. Open the **FitGlue Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Connections** and click **Connect** on Garmin
3. Sign in to your **Garmin account** when redirected
4. Review and **Accept Permissions** to allow FitGlue to access your activities
5. You're connected!

FitGlue uses secure OAuth — your Garmin password is never stored.

## Auth Type: OAuth

Secure OAuth connection.
