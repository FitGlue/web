## Overview

Strava is the social network for athletes. FitGlue connects via OAuth — your Strava password is never stored. You can use Strava as a source (import activities) and/or a destination (upload boosted activities).

## Setup

1. Open the **FitGlue Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Connections** and click **Connect** on Strava
3. Sign in to your **Strava account** when redirected
4. Review and **Accept Permissions**
5. You're connected

## Permissions

FitGlue requests permission to read your activities (when using Strava as a source) and upload activities (when using Strava as a destination). You can revoke access anytime from Strava's app settings.
