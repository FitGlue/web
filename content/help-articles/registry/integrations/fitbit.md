## Overview

Fitbit tracks your activity, heart rate, sleep, and more. FitGlue connects via OAuth — your Fitbit password is never stored. Use Fitbit as a source for activities, or overlay heart rate data onto activities from other sources (e.g. Hevy, Strava).

## Setup

1. Open the **FitGlue Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Connections** and click **Connect** on Fitbit
3. Sign in to your **Fitbit account** when redirected
4. Review and **Accept Permissions**
5. You're connected — activities sync automatically

## What FitGlue Accesses

- Activity data (runs, rides, workouts)
- Heart rate data (for the Fitbit Heart Rate booster)
- Sleep data (if needed for future features)
