## Overview

Hevy is a workout tracking app for strength training. FitGlue connects via API key, allowing your logged activities to flow into FitGlue for enhancement and distribution.

## Hevy Pro Required

The Hevy Developer API requires a **Hevy Pro** subscription. Free tier accounts cannot generate an API key or connect to FitGlue.

## Setup

1. Open the **Hevy app** on your phone
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Scroll down and tap **Developer** (requires Hevy Pro)
4. Tap **Generate API Key**
5. Copy the key and enter it in **FitGlue Dashboard → Connections → Hevy**

## Common Issues

**"Developer" option missing** — You need Hevy Pro. The Developer section only appears for Pro subscribers.

**Connection failed** — Ensure the API key is copied correctly with no extra spaces.
