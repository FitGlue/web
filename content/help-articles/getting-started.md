## Welcome to FitGlue

FitGlue connects your fitness apps and transforms your workout data. In a few minutes, you can have Hevy workouts flowing to Strava with muscle heatmaps, or Fitbit heart rate overlaying your runs.

## Step 1: Create an Account

Head to [fitglue.tech](https://fitglue.tech) and sign up. You'll get a 30-day free Athlete trial—no credit card required.

## Step 2: Connect Your Apps

Go to **Settings → Connections** and connect the apps you use:

- **Hevy** — For strength training (requires Hevy Pro for API access)
- **Strava** — For runs, rides, and activities
- **Fitbit** — For heart rate and activity data
- **Apple Health / Health Connect** — Via the FitGlue mobile app

Each connection uses secure OAuth—we never see your passwords.

## Step 3: Create a Pipeline

A pipeline is: **Source → Boosters → Target**.

1. Go to **Pipelines** and click **Create Pipeline**
2. Choose a **source** (e.g. Hevy, Strava)
3. Add **boosters** (Workout Summary, Muscle Heatmap, etc.)
4. Choose a **target** (e.g. Strava, Showcase)

One source per pipeline. Want multiple sources? Create multiple pipelines.

## Step 4: Let It Run

Once your pipeline is set up, new activities from your source will automatically flow through, get boosted, and land in your target. Check **Activities** to see the results.
