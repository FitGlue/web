Using a heatmap style visualization, you can instantly see which muscles you hit hardest and which ones might be lagging.\n\n### How it works\nEvery exercise in your workout is mapped to primary and secondary muscle groups using our built-in exercise taxonomy. We calculate the volume load for each muscle and generate a \"heatmap\" bar or chart that is appended to your activity description.\n\n### Smart Exercise Recognition\nOur database includes 100+ canonical exercises with fuzzy matching, so even custom-named exercises like \"Dave's Bench Press\" are correctly identified. Abbreviations (DB, BB, KB) are automatically expanded, and typos are handled gracefully.\n  ",
