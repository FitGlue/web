        <p>We believe your fitness data should work for you, not against you. Too many athletes and fitness enthusiasts
          spend precious time manually exporting, converting, and uploading their workout data between platforms.</p>
        <p>FitGlue was born from frustration. Why should a Hevy strength workout require manual exports to appear on
          Strava? Why can't heart rate data from Fitbit automatically enrich your activities? Why is everything so...
          disconnected?</p>

      <div class="animate-on-scroll mt-lg">
        <h2 class="mb-md">What We're Building</h2>
        <p>FitGlue connects the fitness apps that don't talk to each other. We bridge the gaps between
          your workout tracker, your smartwatch, and the platforms where you share your achievements—making sure your
          data is complete, enriched, and looking its best wherever it goes.</p>
        <p>Think of it as the glue between your fitness apps—and the polish that makes everything shine.</p>
