        <h1>Your Data, Protected</h1>
        <p class="legal-last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

        <p>FitGlue connects your fitness apps and enhances your workout data. That means we handle health and activity
            information—and we take that responsibility seriously. This page explains exactly how we protect your data,
            what
            we do (and don't do) with it, and the technical measures we use to keep it safe.</p>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>FitGlue is built on a simple principle: <strong>your data belongs to you</strong>. We act as a secure conduit
            between the fitness platforms you choose to connect—nothing more. We process your data only as you direct,
            and we
            never use it for any purpose beyond delivering the service you've asked for.</p>

        <h2>What We Collect &amp; Why</h2>
        <p>We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide our service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Workout activities:</strong> Exercise type, duration, sets, reps, and performance metrics—used
                to sync
                and enhance your activities across platforms</li>
            <li><strong>Heart rate &amp; health metrics:</strong> When you connect a wearable (Fitbit, Apple Watch,
                etc.),
                we access heart rate data to enrich your activities with training zones and calorie estimates</li>
            <li><strong>GPS &amp; location data:</strong> Route and elevation data from activities (via Strava, FIT file
                uploads, or mobile sync) used to provide location context, elevation profiles, and weather enrichment
            </li>
            <li><strong>Authentication tokens:</strong> OAuth tokens from connected platforms, used exclusively to
                communicate with those services on your behalf</li>
            <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Your email address for login and essential service communications
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We request only the specific permissions needed for each integration—never broad or unnecessary access.</p>

        <h2>What We Never Do</h2>
        <p>We believe in being explicit about boundaries. FitGlue will <strong>never</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell, rent, or trade your health data to any third party</li>
            <li>Use your data for advertising or ad targeting</li>
            <li>Mine your health data for profiling or analytics beyond the service</li>
            <li>Share your data with anyone you haven't explicitly authorised</li>
            <li>Store health data in locations outside our secured infrastructure</li>
            <li>Write false or inaccurate data to Apple Health, Health Connect, or any connected platform</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>
        <p>We implement multiple layers of security to protect your information:</p>

        <h3>Encryption</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In transit:</strong> All data is encrypted using TLS/SSL—every API call, webhook, and browser
                connection is secured</li>
            <li><strong>At rest:</strong> All stored data is encrypted at rest using Google Cloud Platform's default
                encryption with AES-256</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Authentication &amp; Access</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OAuth 2.0:</strong> We use industry-standard OAuth 2.0 for all platform connections (Strava,
                Fitbit,
                etc.), meaning we never see or store your passwords for those services</li>
            <li><strong>API key security:</strong> Ingress API keys are hashed using SHA-256 before storage—we never
                store
                raw keys</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> User accounts are managed through Google's Firebase
                Authentication
                infrastructure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Lifecycle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Credential purge:</strong> When you disconnect an integration, all stored tokens and
                credentials are immediately deleted from our systems and any associated API keys are destroyed</li>
            <li><strong>Full deletion:</strong> Disconnecting a service triggers a complete destruction of all
                connection
                data—not a soft disable, but a hard delete of tokens, keys, and metadata</li>
            <li><strong>Account deletion:</strong> Deleting your account permanently removes all your data,
                deletes all integration credentials, and purges your authentication records</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>You're Always in Control</h2>
        <p>We give you full control over your data at every step:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Granular permissions:</strong> You choose exactly which platforms to connect and what data to
                share
            </li>
            <li><strong>Disconnect anytime:</strong> Remove any integration instantly—all associated data and tokens are
                immediately destroyed</li>
            <li><strong>Delete your account:</strong> Full account deletion is available in-app, removing all data from
                our
                systems</li>
            <li><strong>Data rights:</strong> Under GDPR and UK data protection law, you can request access to,
                correction
                of, or deletion of your personal data at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Platform Compliance</h2>
        <p>FitGlue is designed to meet the health data requirements of both major mobile platforms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple HealthKit:</strong> We comply with Apple's HealthKit guidelines—health data is never used
                for advertising or data mining, is not stored in iCloud, and is accessed only with your explicit
                permission</li>
            <li><strong>Google Health Connect:</strong> We comply with Google Play's Health Connect policies—we request
                only minimum necessary permissions, never commercially exploit health data, and maintain robust security
                controls</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our handling of health data is consistent with both Apple's
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#health-and-health-research"
                style="color: var(--color-primary);" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store Review Guidelines</a> and
            Google's
            <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469"
                style="color: var(--color-primary);" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Health Connect policies</a>.
