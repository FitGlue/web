    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="legal-last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how FitGlue ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information about
      you when you use our website, web application, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the
      "Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
    <p><strong>We will never sell, rent, or trade your personal data to anyone.</strong> Your fitness and health data
      belongs to you, and we only access it with your explicit permission to provide the services you have requested.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create an account, connect a fitness
      platform, upload a file, or contact us for support. We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide the
      Service.</p>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>Email address and authentication credentials, managed securely through Firebase Authentication.</p>

    <h3>Fitness &amp; Workout Data</h3>
    <p>Workout data from connected platforms (such as Hevy, Strava, Fitbit, Garmin, TrainingPeaks, Intervals.icu, and
      others) that you explicitly authorise us to access. This may include exercise type, duration, sets, reps, weights,
      and performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>Health &amp; Biometric Data</h3>
    <p>When you connect a wearable device or health platform, we may access health data including heart rate, training
      zones, and calorie estimates. This data may originate from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple HealthKit (via our iOS app)</li>
      <li>Google Health Connect (via our Android app)</li>
      <li>Fitbit (via API connection)</li>
      <li>FIT file uploads (from Garmin and other devices)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We access this data solely to enrich your activities with training insights. We never use health data for
      advertising, data mining, or any purpose beyond providing the Service.</p>

    <h3>GPS &amp; Location Data</h3>
    <p>Route, elevation, and coordinate data from activities (via connected platforms, FIT file uploads, or mobile
      health sync). This data is used to provide location context, elevation profiles, and weather enrichment for your
      activities.</p>

    <h3>Uploaded Files</h3>
    <p>Files you upload to the Service, such as FIT files from fitness devices. These are processed to extract activity
      data and are stored securely in our infrastructure.</p>

    <h3>Subscription &amp; Billing Data</h3>
    <p>If you subscribe to a paid plan, billing is handled by <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy"
        style="color: var(--color-primary);" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>. We do not store your credit card
      details. We receive only basic subscription status information (plan type, billing period, subscription state)
      from
      Stripe.</p>

    <h3>Push Notification Tokens</h3>
    <p>If you enable push notifications, we collect a device token via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver
      notifications about your activity processing. These tokens contain no personal information.</p>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>Basic information about how you use our Service, and error reporting data via
      <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" style="color: var(--color-primary);" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Sentry</a> to help us identify and fix issues.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

      <li>Process and sync your fitness data between the platforms you connect</li>
      <li>Enhance your activities with additional insights (boosters) such as heart rate zones, weather context,
        personal
        records, and AI-generated descriptions</li>
      <li>Generate Showcase pages when you choose to share an activity publicly</li>
      <li>Send you push notifications about activity processing status</li>

    <h2>Showcase &amp; Publicly Shared Content</h2>
    <p>When you create a Showcase page for an activity, the enriched activity data for that specific activity is made
      publicly accessible via a unique URL. This may include workout details, heart rate data, maps, and other
      enrichments. You control which activities are shared, and you can remove a Showcase page at any time.</p>
